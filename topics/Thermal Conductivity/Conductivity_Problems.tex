\section{New Problem 1: The Composite Rod}

\subsection*{Question Text}
\begin{quote}
A composite cylindrical rod is constructed from a \SI{30.0}{\centi\meter} section of aluminum and a \SI{50.0}{\centi\meter} section of steel, joined end-to-end. Both sections have a diameter of \SI{4.00}{\centi\meter}. The aluminum end is placed in thermal contact with boiling water at \SI{100}{\celsius}, while the steel end is in contact with a large reservoir of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point of \SI{77.0}{\kelvin}. The rod is well-insulated along its sides.

(i) Find the temperature at the junction where the two sections are joined.

(ii) Calculate the total rate of heat flow through the composite rod.

(iii) What is the total rate of change of entropy for the system (hot reservoir + cold reservoir + rod)?

\noindent
\textbf{Given:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Thermal conductivity of Aluminum, $k_{Al} = \SI{237}{\watt\per\meter\per\kelvin}$
    \item Thermal conductivity of Steel, $k_{St} = \SI{45.0}{\watt\per\meter\per\kelvin}$
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\subsection*{Explanation and Solution}
\subsubsection*{Conceptual Breakdown}
This problem involves heat conduction through two different materials connected in series.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a steady state, the rate of heat flow ($P$) must be the same through both sections of the rod. If it were not, energy would accumulate at the junction, causing its temperature to change, which contradicts the steady-state assumption.
    \item We can write Fourier's Law for each section separately. Let $T_H$ be the hot temperature (\SI{100}{\celsius}), $T_C$ be the cold temperature (\SI{77}{\kelvin}), and $T_J$ be the unknown junction temperature.
    \item By equating the heat flow rates ($P_{Al} = P_{St}$), we can solve for $T_J$.
    \item Once $T_J$ is known, we can calculate the heat flow rate $P$ using the parameters of either section.
    \item The rate of entropy change is calculated for the hot and cold reservoirs, remembering that the rod itself is in a steady state and has no net entropy change over time.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Part (i): Junction Temperature ($T_J$)}
First, convert all temperatures to Kelvin:
$T_H = \SI{100}{\celsius} + 273.15 = \SI{373.15}{\kelvin}$. $T_C$ is already \SI{77}{\kelvin}.
The cross-sectional area $A$ is the same for both sections:
$A = \pi r^2 = \pi (\SI{0.0200}{\meter})^2 = 4\pi \times 10^{-4} \, \si{\meter\squared} \approx \SI{1.257e-3}{\meter\squared}$.

In steady state, $P_{Al} = P_{St}$:
\[ \frac{k_{Al} A (T_H - T_J)}{L_{Al}} = \frac{k_{St} A (T_J - T_C)}{L_{St}} \]
The area $A$ cancels out:
\[ \frac{k_{Al}}{L_{Al}} (T_H - T_J) = \frac{k_{St}}{L_{St}} (T_J - T_C) \]
Now, substitute the values and solve for $T_J$:
\[ \frac{237}{0.30} (373.15 - T_J) = \frac{45.0}{0.50} (T_J - 77.0) \]
\[ 790 (373.15 - T_J) = 90 (T_J - 77.0) \]
\[ 294788.5 - 790 T_J = 90 T_J - 6930 \]
\[ 301718.5 = 880 T_J \]
\[ T_J = \frac{301718.5}{880} \approx \SI{342.86}{\kelvin} \]
Converting back to Celsius: $T_J = 342.86 - 273.15 = \SI{69.7}{\celsius}$.

\subsubsection*{Part (ii): Rate of Heat Flow ($P$)}
We can use the parameters for either section to find $P$. Let's use aluminum:
\[ P = \frac{k_{Al} A (T_H - T_J)}{L_{Al}} = \frac{(237)(\SI{1.257e-3}{\meter\squared})(\SI{373.15}{\kelvin} - \SI{342.86}{\kelvin})}{\SI{0.30}{\meter}} \]
\[ P = \frac{(237)(\SI{1.257e-3}{})(30.29)}{0.30} \approx \SI{30.0}{\watt} \]

\subsubsection*{Part (iii): Total Rate of Entropy Change}
The rod is in a steady state, so its entropy does not change ($\frac{dS_{rod}}{dt} = 0$). We only consider the reservoirs.
\[ \frac{dS_{\text{total}}}{dt} = \frac{dS_{\text{hot}}}{dt} + \frac{dS_{\text{cold}}}{dt} = \frac{-P}{T_H} + \frac{+P}{T_C} \]
\[ \frac{dS_{\text{total}}}{dt} = \frac{-\SI{30.0}{\watt}}{\SI{373.15}{\kelvin}} + \frac{\SI{30.0}{\watt}}{\SI{77.0}{\kelvin}} \]
\[ \frac{dS_{\text{total}}}{dt} = -0.0804 + 0.3896 = \SI{0.309}{\joule\per\kelvin\per\second} \]
The total entropy of the system increases, as expected for an irreversible process.

\section{New Problem 2: The Cooling Sphere}

\subsection*{Question Text}
\begin{quote}
A solid iron sphere of radius \SI{5.0}{\centi\meter} is heated to an initial temperature of \SI{300}{\celsius}. It is then suspended by an insulating thread and fully submerged in a well-insulated container holding a mixture of \SI{500}{\gram} of ice and \SI{500}{\gram} of water, initially at thermal equilibrium at \SI{0}{\celsius}.

Assuming heat is conducted uniformly from the entire surface of the sphere into the mixture, how long does it take for the sphere to cool down to \SI{100}{\celsius}?

\noindent
\textbf{Hint:} The rate of heat loss from the sphere depends on its own changing temperature. You will need to set up and solve a differential equation.

\noindent
\textbf{Given:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Density of iron, $\rho_{Fe} = \SI{7870}{\kilogram\per\cubic\meter}$
    \item Specific heat capacity of iron, $c_{Fe} = \SI{450}{\joule\per\kilogram\per\kelvin}$
    \item Specific heat capacity of water, $c_w = \SI{4200}{\joule\per\kilogram\per\kelvin}$
    \item Latent heat of fusion of water, $L_f = \SI{3.34e5}{\joule\per\kilogram}$
    \item Consider the "length" of conduction to be the radius of the sphere.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\subsection*{Explanation and Solution}
\subsubsection*{Conceptual Breakdown}
This problem involves heat transfer from a source whose temperature is changing over time. The process occurs in two stages for the ice-water mixture:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Stage 1: Melting Ice.} The sphere cools from \SI{300}{\celsius} to some intermediate temperature, $T_1$. The heat it loses is used to melt all the ice at a constant mixture temperature of \SI{0}{\celsius}.
    \item \textbf{Stage 2: Heating Water.} The sphere continues to cool from $T_1$ down to the final temperature of \SI{100}{\celsius}. The heat it loses is now used to raise the temperature of the entire mass of water (initial water + melted ice) from \SI{0}{\celsius} to some final temperature, $T_{f,w}$.
\end{enumerate}
In both stages, the rate of heat flow is not constant because the sphere's temperature, $T_{Fe}(t)$, is decreasing. This requires integration.

\subsubsection*{Preliminary Calculations}
Mass of the iron sphere, $m_{Fe}$:
\[ m_{Fe} = \rho_{Fe} V = \rho_{Fe} \left(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\right) = (\SI{7870}{}) \left(\frac{4}{3}\pi (\SI{0.05}{\meter})^3\right) \approx \SI{4.12}{\kilogram} \]
Heat required to melt all the ice ($Q_{melt}$):
\[ Q_{melt} = m_{ice} L_f = (\SI{0.5}{\kilogram})(\SI{3.34e5}{\joule\per\kilogram}) = \SI{167000}{\joule} \]

\subsubsection*{Stage 1: Sphere Cools While Melting Ice ($t_1$)}
Let $T_{Fe}$ be the sphere's temperature. The mixture is at $T_C = \SI{0}{\celsius} = \SI{273.15}{\kelvin}$.
The heat lost by the sphere in cooling by $dT_{Fe}$ is $dQ = -m_{Fe} c_{Fe} dT_{Fe}$. (The negative sign is because heat is lost as temperature decreases).
The rate of heat flow out of the sphere is $P = \frac{dQ}{dt}$. For this problem, we are told to model the conduction over the length of the radius, $r$.
\[ \frac{dQ}{dt} = \frac{k A (T_{Fe} - T_C)}{r} \quad \text{(Note: this is a simplification)} \]
Wait, the problem doesn't give a thermal conductivity for water or a convection coefficient. This means we cannot use Fourier's law directly. The problem is simpler: it's a calorimetry problem that requires integration over time.

Let's re-evaluate. The rate of heat lost by the sphere is:
\[ \frac{dQ}{dt} = -m_{Fe}c_{Fe}\frac{dT_{Fe}}{dt} \]
Let's assume the rate of heat transfer is proportional to the temperature difference, which is a common simplification (Newton's Law of Cooling). Let's assume the problem meant for us to find the total energy exchange first.

Let's find the temperature $T_1$ the sphere reaches when all ice is melted.
Heat lost by sphere = Heat gained by ice.
\[ m_{Fe}c_{Fe}(T_{i,Fe} - T_1) = Q_{melt} \]
\[ (\SI{4.12}{})(\SI{450}{})(300 - T_1) = 167000 \]
\[ 1854(300 - T_1) = 167000 \]
\[ 300 - T_1 = \frac{167000}{1854} \approx 90.08 \]
\[ T_1 = 300 - 90.08 = \SI{209.9}{\celsius} \]
Since $T_1 = \SI{209.9}{\celsius}$ is above the final temperature of \SI{100}{\celsius}, the process does indeed have two stages.

This problem is ill-defined without a heat transfer coefficient or thermal conductivity. Let's redefine the problem to be solvable with the given concepts.

\subsubsection*{Revised Problem 2 and Solution}
Let's assume the question implies a constant heat flow rate for simplicity, perhaps by stating the *initial* rate of heat flow. A more interesting problem that is solvable is a variation of the original SPhO 2020 problem.

\paragraph{New Question Text for Problem 2:}
A well-insulated container holds \SI{2.0}{\kilogram} of a liquid with specific heat capacity \SI{2500}{\joule\per\kilogram\per\kelvin}. The liquid is initially at \SI{10}{\celsius}. A copper rod of length \SI{40}{\centi\meter} and diameter \SI{1.5}{\centi\meter} has one end immersed in the liquid, while the other is maintained in a steam bath at \SI{100}{\celsius}. How long does it take for the liquid's temperature to rise from \SI{10}{\celsius} to \SI{50}{\celsius}?
[Thermal conductivity of copper $= \SI{400}{\watt\per\meter\per\kelvin}$]

\paragraph{Solution}
This problem mirrors the logic of the original SPhO 2020 problem's second stage. The temperature of the cold reservoir, $T_C(t)$, changes over time.

1.  \textbf{Set up the differential equation}:
    The heat $dQ$ flowing into the liquid raises its temperature by $dT_C$.
    \[ dQ = m_{liq} c_{liq} dT_C \]
    This heat is supplied by the rod at a non-constant rate, which depends on the liquid's current temperature $T_C$:
    \[ \frac{dQ}{dt} = P(t) = \frac{kA(T_H - T_C(t))}{L} \]
    Equating the two expressions for $dQ$:
    \[ m_{liq} c_{liq} dT_C = \frac{kA(T_H - T_C)}{L} dt \]

2.  \textbf{Separate variables and integrate}:
    Rearrange the equation to separate the time variables ($dt$) and temperature variables ($dT_C$).
    \[ dt = \frac{m_{liq} c_{liq} L}{kA} \frac{dT_C}{T_H - T_C} \]
    Now, integrate both sides. The time $t$ goes from 0 to the final time $t_f$. The temperature of the cold liquid $T_C$ goes from the initial \SI{10}{\celsius} to the final \SI{50}{\celsius}.
    \[ \int_0^{t_f} dt = \frac{m_{liq} c_{liq} L}{kA} \int_{10}^{50} \frac{dT_C}{100 - T_C} \]

3.  \textbf{Perform the integration}:
    The integral of $\frac{1}{100-T_C}$ with respect to $T_C$ is $-\ln(100 - T_C)$.
    \[ t_f = \frac{m_{liq} c_{liq} L}{kA} \left[-\ln(100 - T_C)\right]_{10}^{50} \]
    \[ t_f = \frac{m_{liq} c_{liq} L}{kA} \left( (-\ln(100 - 50)) - (-\ln(100 - 10)) \right) \]
    \[ t_f = \frac{m_{liq} c_{liq} L}{kA} \left( \ln(90) - \ln(50) \right) = \frac{m_{liq} c_{liq} L}{kA} \ln\left(\frac{90}{50}\right) \]

4.  \textbf{Substitute values and calculate}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $m_{liq} = \SI{2.0}{\kilogram}$
        \item $c_{liq} = \SI{2500}{\joule\per\kilogram\per\kelvin}$
        \item $L = \SI{0.40}{\meter}$
        \item $k = \SI{400}{\watt\per\meter\per\kelvin}$
        \item $A = \pi r^2 = \pi (\frac{\SI{0.015}{\meter}}{2})^2 = \pi (\SI{0.0075}{\meter})^2 \approx \SI{1.767e-4}{\meter\squared}$
    \end{itemize}
    \[ t_f = \frac{(\SI{2.0}{})(\SI{2500}{})(\SI{0.40}{})}{(\SI{400}{})(\SI{1.767e-4}{})} \ln(1.8) \]
    \[ t_f = \frac{2000}{0.07068} \ln(1.8) \approx (28296.5)(0.5878) \approx \SI{16634}{\second} \]
    This is approximately $\frac{16634}{60} \approx \SI{277}{\minute}$.
